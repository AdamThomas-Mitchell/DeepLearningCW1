# DeepLearningCW1

Code to solve gridworld problem using reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm. 

Contains 2 class objects; GridWorld and QLearningAgent

IMPORTANT:
at end of file there are 3 functions that can be run; task_c(), task_e(), epsilon_test()
Only run one of these at once or else there will be a lot of output and it will be difficult to distinguish what is what 
Make sure 2 of these functions are commented out when running programme
